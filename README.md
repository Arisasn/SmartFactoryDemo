# Miniature Smart Manufacturing Line

This project is a **small-scale factory automation simulation**, inspired by real-world smart manufacturing at companies like Foxconn.  
It uses **two Makeblock mBot robots**, a **Raspberry Pi**, and IoT communication to demonstrate:
- Autonomous vehicle navigation.
- Collision detection and safety systems.
- Real-time monitoring via a custom dashboard.

## Hardware
- 2× Makeblock mBots
- 1× Raspberry Pi (Model 3 or 4 recommended)
- Ultrasonic sensors (for collision detection)
- IR sensors or line-following sensors
- USB power supply and cables

## Project Goals
1. Simulate autonomous mobile robots used in manufacturing plants.
2. Build a Raspberry Pi hub to coordinate data and control.
3. Create a web dashboard for real-time tracking and analytics.
4. Demonstrate safety protocols with collision avoidance.

## Repository Structure
- `hardware/` → wiring diagrams, component details.
- `code/` → car Arduino scripts & Raspberry Pi controller.
- `dashboard/` → web dashboard scripts.
- `demo/` → pictures and final video demo.

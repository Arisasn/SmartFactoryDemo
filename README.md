# Smart Factory AGV Network

A scalable **factory automation system** demonstrating two Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs), both simulated.  
Designed to mirror **Industry 4.0 concepts** like those used in modern smart manufacturing (e.g., Foxconn).

## System Architecture
- **mini-pc with kali-linux**: Runs MQTT broker and control dashboard.
- **Simulated Robot**: Software-only process for testing scalability.

## Goals
- Live dashboard with telemetry from multiple robots.
- Autonomous line-following and obstacle detection.
- Demo video showing virtual robots working together.

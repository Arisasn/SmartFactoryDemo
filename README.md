# Smart Factory AGV Network (Virtual)

This project simulates a modrn factory network of autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs). Originally planned with physcial robots, it has been fully migrated to a **virtual system** to allow rapid development, scaling, and clear demonstration of smart factory concepts.

## Features
- MQTT-based communication between hub and AGVs
- Flask dashboard for real-time control and telemetry
- Easily scale to 10+ virtual robots
- Pure Python implementation - no hardware required
